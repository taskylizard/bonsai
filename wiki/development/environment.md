# Environment

- [direnv](https://direnv.net/) - Set shell variables when you change into a directory.
- [asdf](https://asdf-vm.com/) - Manage and use specific versions of software, works with direnv too.
- [rtx](https://github.com/jdxcode/rtx) - asdf but nicer.
- [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) - Git hooks for various languages, very customizable.
- [git-conventional-commits](https://github.com/qoomon/git-conventional-commits) - Enforce customizable (Angular, etc) commit messages, works with pre-commit too.
- [lsd](https://github.com/lsd-rs/lsd) - The next gen ls command, icons, colors, directory tree.
- [bat](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat) - `cat` clone, is very good, though I enable `--plain` because I need to copy code sometimes.
